🎭 Game Design Plan
Mask Off: The Hypocrisy Hunter

Genre: Satirical Arcade / Reflex
Core Emotion: Suspicion → Tension → Satisfaction
Core Skill: Observation + Timing (not blind clicking)

1. Core Design Philosophy (Important Improvement)

👉 The game should reward patience and awareness, not aggression.

If players spam clicks, they should lose badly.
If players wait, observe, and strike at the right moment, they dominate.

This reinforces the satire mechanically:

Blind belief is punished. Critical thinking is rewarded.

2. Core Loop (Refined)

Character pops up from a hole

Player watches for micro-signals

Mask briefly slips

Player reacts

Immediate feedback (visual + sound + text)

Difficulty escalates

Repeat until timer ends

This loop should feel fast, tense, and readable.

3. Grid & Layout

3×3 Grid (9 holes)

Holes are circular, with subtle shadow depth

Characters pop up from waist-up (classic whack-a-mole clarity)

Middle hole slightly higher chance to spawn (keeps focus central)

👉 Later difficulty can unlock:

4×3 grid (12 holes) for advanced mode

4. Character States (Improved Readability)
   🟢 State A — “The Mask” (Trap)

Duration: ~1.0–1.2s
Visual cues:

Calm smile

Soft glow / halo effect

Hands in prayer pose

Slow breathing animation

If clicked:

❌ −5 points

Screen shake (small)

Red text:
“Sentiment Shielded!”

Sound:

Disapproving crowd murmur

Soft “thud” (no impact sound)

🔴 State B — “The Slip” (Target)

Duration: 200–400ms (varies by difficulty)

Visual cues (important improvement):

Mask cracks instead of disappearing instantly

Micro-expressions:

Greedy grin

Side-eye glance

Horn shadow flicker

Coin / power / vote icon flashes briefly

If clicked:

✅ +10 points

Freeze-frame hit effect (0.1s)

Big stamp animation:
“CAUGHT!”

Sound:

Sharp “smack”

Excuse voice line (randomized)

5. Timing System (More Depth)

Instead of totally random mask slips:

Probability-Weighted Slip System

Each character may or may not slip

Players must decide:

“Do I wait… or ignore?”

Difficulty Slip Chance Slip Duration
Easy 80% 400ms
Normal 60% 300ms
Hard 40% 200ms

👉 Some characters never slip (pure bait).

6. Anti-Spam System (Critical Improvement)
   🧠 Blind Clicking Punishment

If player clicks 3 wrong hits in a row:

Screen text: “Blind Faith Mode!”

For 3 seconds:

Slips become rarer

Mask duration increases

Sound gets muffled

This forces restraint.

7. Combo & Risk System (Depth)
   Combo Meter

Consecutive correct hits = combo multiplier

Example:

2 hits → ×1.2

4 hits → ×1.5

6 hits → ×2.0

Risk Factor

Waiting too long = character disappears

No penalty, but missed opportunity

Encourages fast but thoughtful play

8. Characters Variety (Replay Value)

Introduce archetypes, not just clones:

Type Behavior
The Preacher Long mask, very fast slip
The Smiler Fake kindness, rare slip
The Shouter Loud audio bait
The Vanisher Short popup, high reward
The Puppet Slip only after another is hit 9. Audio Design (Very Important)
Voice Lines (When Hit)

Random pool, distorted/cartoonish:

“It’s a conspiracy!”

“You misunderstood me!”

“This is out of context!”

“I never said that!”

Crowd Reactions

Correct hit → cheers

Wrong hit → awkward silence

10. UI & Feedback (Polish)
    HUD

⏱ Timer top-right

🧮 Score top-center

🔥 Combo meter bottom-center

Text Feedback (Short, Punchy)

“CAUGHT!”

“MASK INTACT!”

“WAIT…”

“TOO EARLY!”

11. End Screen (Improved)
